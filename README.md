# MatterOverdrive-ReWrite-Edition-1.19.2
A rewrite of MatterOverdrive Community Edition

I am on a mission to rewrite the MatterOverdrive Community Edition Minecraft mod for 1.19.2.
I will be using the old code as a reference to hopefully speed the process up, but this may/will take a while with my schedule so please bear with me.

Update: I realized I am not just updating from version 1.12.2, I am also updating from Java 8 to 17. Any timeframe I had is now out the window. Please continue to bear with me.
