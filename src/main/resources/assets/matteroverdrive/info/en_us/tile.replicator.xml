        <text class="matter-text text-block">$itemName, is a machine, that uses transporter technology to materialize item patterns into their physical counterpart. By rearranging subatomic particles on a larger scale with [guide name=matter_plasma], it replicates items and blocks. Thus its name, $itemName.</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title">How To Use</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Before you can replicate an item, you must have it's pattern. A pattern can be obtained by scanning the item with a [item name=matter_scanner] or [item name=matter_analyzer]. Unfortunately the scanning process destroys the item.
            Every time an item is scanned, it's progress to 100% pattern completion will increase. A Redstone signal may be required to start the replication process, depending on the redstone setting of the machine.
            [guide name=matter_plasma] is also required to replicate items. How much depends on the item itself.</text>
        <text class="matter-text">Be warned! The replication process produces high amounts of radiation. Without protective plating any living creature will receive large doses of radiation followed by a ton of negative potion effects, such as Hunger, Nausea, Fatigue,Weakness and Poison. To protect against radiation, a maximum of 5 [item name=tritanium_plate] can be used to protect the user from the deadly radiation. Each plate also decreases the area of effect.</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title">How To Use</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">If you use a pattern that is less than 100% complete,
            the replicator will have a greater chance of failure and will produce [item name=matter_dust guide=matter_fail].
            If you try and replicate an item with a pattern processed at 10% it will fail about 10% of the time.
            Then you will have to use a [block name=matter_recycler] to convert it into [item name=matter_dust_refined guide=matter_fail] and decompose it back into [guide name=matter_plasma].</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title ">Matter Network</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName can only have [item name=network_pipe] connected to its back side. Once connected to a network, the [item name=pattern_monitor] can be used to issue replication tasks, to all connected replicators.
            Once given a replication task, the $itemName will search the Local Network for valid patterns.
            A [item name=network_flash_drive] can be used to filter machines with which the $itemName can communicate.</text>
